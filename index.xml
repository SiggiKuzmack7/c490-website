By &amp;ldquo;top-level&amp;rdquo; I mean that it should be a sibling of archetypes and content. Name the new folder static. Put an image in that folder.
To link your image from a post, use code like this:
![Here is frog](/frog.jpg) Notice that we don&amp;rsquo;t type ../frog.jpg or ../../static/frog.jpg or anything that is so intuitive. The address is translated by Hugo&amp;rsquo;s backend into the correct thing.</description></item><item><title>My educational experiences</title><link>http://daverosoff.github.io/c490-website/posts/brianmann/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 13:24:53 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://daverosoff.github.io/c490-website/posts/brianmann/</guid><description>I was initially introduced to this as a suggestion from my professor last year. It was described as a rather fun class which wasn&amp;rsquo;t a requirement for the major. I decided to take it because it sounded like something that would help stimulate my thinking sponge for a while since it promised so much variety in the topics related to computer science. Plus, it would probably be a million times no interesting than my last winter term course.</description></item></channel></rss>
